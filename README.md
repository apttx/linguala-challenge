# Linguala Challenge

We're a small startup and always looking for people to help us build a web-platform all about language services. This repo is an easy way to show off what you know & what you've learned.

## Stack

We use Node (Koa), GraphQL (Apollo), MongoDB & React with Gatsby and would like you to use the same. DB isn't as important; if you know your way around something else, that's fine here, too.

## Challenges

We've got three topics we're currently working on:
- User authentication via identity providers
- Translator profiles (via GraphQL)
- Web app to display & interact with everything

You don't have to know all of this. Pick the one you're familiar with & mock the rest as you need it.

- [Authentication](challenges/auth.md)
